hi. this is an alpha 0.06 (2011-10-04) of mode/perl.js (text/x-perl)

fixes: eating of operators, predefined variables and regexp.

bugs: electricChars: I don't understand, how it work. need help.
      regular expressions highlighting:
      $regexp=~s[is][working]gx;
      $regexp=~s[is
		][working]gx;
      $regexp=~s[is][
                      not working
                    ]gx;

something may be wrong.
