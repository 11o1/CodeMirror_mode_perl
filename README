hi. this is an alpha 0.03 (2011-10-01) of mode/perl.js (text/x-perl)

something may be wrong.

now this work as a mirror of clike.js, but with perl keywords, multiline strings and regexp.

numbers like:

1_000_000.123

strings like:

"..\".."; '..\'..'; qq(..); qw^..^;

regular expressions like:

qr/.*?(?=x)/;

/something\ reg[eE]xp\ strings/;

tr///; y///;

m[
  something as well
]x;

m{[^x]+}o;

s/  (x?)      /
  if($1){"y"}
              /gosex;

$var=<<HTML
  this strings is not working now...
HTML

at the end of perl.js I added a new function "stream.look(index)" for a look-ahead and look-behind. 
it's work like "stream.peek()", but with an index.

next steps: regexp highlighting, <<VAR...VAR and more and more...

sabaca.
